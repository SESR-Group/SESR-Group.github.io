We are delighted to welcome Adam Codona, who joined the SESR Group as a PhD student in September 2025. 
Adam gained a master’s in chemical engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He has worked in energy storage for three years: first, developing a lithium-sulphur flow battery at StorTera, then on underground energy storage, at Gravitricity. 
Adam is now undertaking a PhD during which he aims to develop a zinc-ion flow battery, manufactured from recycled primary alkaline batteries.
