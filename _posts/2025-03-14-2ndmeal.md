On White Valentine’s Day, [Dr. Nikiforidis Georgios](/_members/99nikiforidis-georgios.md), Mr. Haotian Ma, Mr. William Chen, Mr. Sijin Liu, and Mr. Yanzhuo Li took a break from their busy research schedules to enjoy a group dinner together.

Throughout the evening, the conversation naturally flowed from lighthearted topics—favorite cuisines, travel anecdotes, and holiday memories—to in-depth discussions about their current research projects, emerging scientific developments, and future professional aspirations. The blend of laughter and intellectual exchange created a memorable atmosphere, illustrating the positive synergy that can arise when colleagues connect outside the lab.

Each participant brought a unique perspective to the table. Dr. Nikiforidis Georgios offered insights drawn from his academic expertise and extensive research background, while Mr. Haotian Ma, Mr. William Chen, Mr. Sijin Liu, and Mr. Yanzhuo Li contributed fresh ideas and complementary skill sets. Together, they exemplified the notion that collaboration thrives when people of diverse backgrounds unite in a spirit of curiosity and mutual respect.
