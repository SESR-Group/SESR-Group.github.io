Adam is currently a PhD researcher in the Sustainable Energy Storage & Recycling Group supervised by Dr. Georgios Nikiforidis at the Institute for Materials Discovery (IMD), University College London (UCL).

Adam gained a master’s in chemical engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He has worked in energy storage for three years: first, developing a lithium-sulphur flow battery at StorTera, then on underground energy storage at Gravitricity.
Adam is now undertaking a PhD during which he aims to develop a zinc-ion flow battery, manufactured from recycled primary alkaline batteries.
