Hello, my name is Ziwei(William) Chen. I completed my undergraduate and master degree in the Department of Chemistry at UCL. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD's degree at UCL's Institute of Materials Discovery, under the supervision of my advisor, Georgios Nikiforidis.

I am previously working on a project focused on the hydrometallurgical recycling of lithium-ion batteries. The process involves dissolving the cathode material in inorganic acids, followed by sequential chemical precipitation to extract various valuable metals from the cathode material.
