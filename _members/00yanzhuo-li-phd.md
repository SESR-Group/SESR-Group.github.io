Yanzhuo Li's research focuses on recovering lithium cobalt oxide from lithium-ion batteries using a citric acid leaching process.  He employs the principle of complexometric colorimetry with UV-vis spectrophotometry for quantitative analysis of the recovery efficiency.  Li's passion for research, critical thinking skills, and ability to independently analyze experimental issues enable him to propose his own improvement plans based on existing literature.  His strong communication skills allow him to explain his research clearly and concisely, facilitating quick and clear understanding by others.  Li's exploratory spirit drives him to experiment with various approaches and methods, conducting comparative analyses to enhance his research.

Li's research stands out for several reasons.  Firstly, he utilizes discarded single-use e-cigarettes as a source for lithium-ion battery recovery, providing a novel approach to recycling e-cigarette batteries.  Secondly, the use of an organic acid leaching process aligns with environmental protection and sustainable development principles.  Lastly, by employing complexometric colorimetry, he can quickly and easily quantify the recovery efficiency of lithium cobalt oxide using UV-vis spectrophotometry.
